# AustinTrafficAccidentsToday


Visualization of today's traffic accidents in Austin with real time data (More to be added)
  1- Data comes from https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Real-Time-Traffic-Incident-Reports/dx9v-zd7x
  2- It is necessary to authenticate the API to get the full dataset
  3- Everytime we run the entire notebook we gather today's data and create a new visualization

Visualization (Might not show properly on the GitHut notebook)
